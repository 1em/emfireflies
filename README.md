# emfireflies: Fireflies in Flask

Install requirements with:
```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```
(If you don't have pip installed, you can look up directions for that online.)

Install Heroku Toolbelt at toolbelt.heroku.com.
This will allow you to use the foreman command to start the server.

Run your server with:
```
    foreman start
```

Check your local server at the url:
```
    localhost:5000
```

elements from the Flask views.py function.
